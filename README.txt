In this repositopry all of my projects that are no longer active and of no use to anyone but me are 
stored they, there here more to show a coding style and what sort of projects i have worked on in 
the past. As such there is very little information as to why each project was started and finished, 
I will try to document that information here for the benifet of others that may be looking at 
this repository.

NWEN = Network Engineering
SWEN = Software Engineering
COMP = Computer Science

EcoTrails:
    For one of my NWEN course we were tolded to make a app that had to help inprove the 
    enviroment in someway. So the team as i was working in a team at the time designed this app 
    that would attempt to measure your form of transport. then a grading ssytem was created on 
    how bad your form of travel was so walking and bicycle was good will all forms of personal 
    transport was bad and public transport was a 50/50 kind of responce. I was incharge of making 
    the program that did the classification of transport will my team mates consintrated on the 
    app and the server that the app was going to talk to. In the end this project didn't go much 
    fearther after the marks were handed out and so it has been left to sit in my back up file 
    system till restored here. The Classifier is very harsh and doesn't screen out outliers 
    very well as i ran out of time and had to help the app team fix concurrincy issues. But 
    it will give you a responce to data though it is not alsway the best responce.

 BusTimeTable:
    This was a assignment in another one of my NWEN projects i believe for the same course as 
    above the point here was to make a bus time table system for the android device that used 
    up to date data from the mete services schedual system as we were not using the live data. 
    we had to get the file form the university system and build some way of working out if the 
    file had been updated, and if it had then download a new file.
